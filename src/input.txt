Here, exception-list is a comma-separated list of the exceptions that a method can throw.
Following is an example of an incorrect program that tries to throw an exception that it
does not catch. Because the program does not specify a throws clause to declare this fact, the
program will not compile.
<block>
class ThrowsDemo {
static void throwOne() {
System.out.println("Inside throwOne.");
throw new IllegalAccessException("demo");
}
public static void main(String args[]) {
throwOne();
}
}
</block>
To make this example compile, you need to make two changes. First, you need to declare
that throwOne( ) throws IllegalAccessException. Second, main( ) must define a try/catch
statement that catches this exception.
The corrected example is shown here.
